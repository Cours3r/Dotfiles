# Dotfiles

This repository if my collection of dotfiles for running arch and openbox. The majority are copied from other users from r/unixporn and tweaked for my personal use. The goal is to learn and build my own files.

### Included

i3 - config file for i3-gaps

-> location: ~/.config/i3/

lockscreen - lock2.sh and icon, used to lock screen in openbox and i3-gaps

-> location: ~/.xlock/

Mouse - libinput config for touchpad on laptop

location -> /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d 

openbox - my openbox config files (rc.xml, autostart, enviorment, menu.xml)

-> location: ~/.config/openbox/

termite - config file for termite terminal emulator

-> location: ~/.config/termite/

tint2 - task bar from tint2

-> location: ~/.config/tint2/

zsh - my custom zsh prompt & .zshrc

-> location: .zshrc -> ~/

.             theme -> ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/themes/

### Bugs/Issues:

* Lock screen image doesn't scale, on a larger monitor it will require a manual resize

### Acknowledgments

* dlcgold - used his FullMetalArch config to get a starting point with openbox
