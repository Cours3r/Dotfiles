# Dotfiles

This repository if my collection of dotfiles for running arch and openbox. The majority are copied from other users from r/unixporn and tweaked for my personal use. The goal is to learn and build my own files.

### Included

Mouse - libinput config for touchpad on laptop

location -> /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d 

lockscreen - lock2.sh and icon, used to lock screen in openbox

-> location: ~/.xlock/

openbox - my openbox config files (rc.xml, autostart, enviorment, menu.xml)

-> location: ~/.config/openbox/

termite - config file for termite terminal emulator

-> location: ~/.config/termite/

zsh - my custom zsh prompt & .zshrc

-> location: .zshrc -> ~/

.             theme -> ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/themes/

tint2 - task bar from tint2

-> location: ~/.config/tint2/

### Bugs/Issues:

* Lock screen image doesn't scale, on a larger monitor it will require a manual resize

### Acknowledgments

* dlcgold - used his FullMetalArch config

### TODO

* Get a good (stable) st config.h and pkgbuild going
